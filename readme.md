# WEB APPLICATION SUPPORTING MATERIAL ONLINE (SMOL)

### Description
Supporting Material Online (SMOL) is a website application developed using CodeIgnitier Web Framework and MySQL as the database. SMOL developed to manage the inventory of supporting material goods which includes the process of checking whether the goods match the specifications. The previous application still used paper or word documents so that the data was not well integrated and there was no guarding when the material could be used or not. From these problems, the SMOL application was made to solve these problems.
